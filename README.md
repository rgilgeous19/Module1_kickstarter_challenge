# KICKSTARTING WITH EXCEL

 ## Overview of Project
     
  ### _Purpose_
      The overview of the project is to create two new analyses for Louise's play.The purpose of the project is 
      to analyze and determine whether there are specific factors to make a project's campaign successful.
      I determine if different plays have been more successful, failedor canceled based on their launch date
      or by the goals set the play.
      
## Analysis and Challenges
      
   ### _Analysis of Outcomes Bases on Launch Date_
       Based on the 'Theater Outcomes by Launch Date' analysis, I can see that 61.2% of the plays has been successful, 
       36% has failed and 2.8% has been cancelled. The most successful month was May, while the most failed 
       outcomes were also in May. There has also been less than 10 cancelations for each month for one year.

   ### _Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals_
       Based on the 'Outcomes Based on Goals' analysis, the highest number of successful plays is 388 with a goal of
       $1000 to $4999 while the highest number of failed plays was 146 also at a goal of $1000 to $4999. Even
       though the percentage in 'Percentage Successful' is lower in the 1000 to 4999 goal, there are more
       successful plays compared to the number of successful plays within the >1000 goal. Even if I deducted the
       number of failed plays within the 1000 to 4999 range, there are still 101 plays more successful than that 
       of the successful plays in the >1000 goal. There has also been 0 cancellations of plays within all the goal ranges.
