# KICKSTARTING WITH EXCEL

 ## Overview of Project
     
  ### _Purpose_
      The overview of the project is to create two new analyses for Louise's play.The purpose
      of the project is to analyze and determine whether there are specific factors to make
      a project's campaign successful and to determine if different plays have been more successful, 
      failed or canceled based on their launche date or by the goals set in the plays.
      
## Analysis and Challenges
      
   ### _Analysis of Outcomes Bases on Launch Date_
       Based on the 'Theater Outcomes by Launch Date' analysis, I can see that 61.2% of the plays has been successful, 
       36% has failed and 2.8% has been cancelled. The most successful month was May, while the most failed 
       outcomes were also in May.For every month during the year, there was 50% failed outcomes than that of the
       successful outcomes. There has also been less than 10 cancelations for each month for one year.

   ### _Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals_
       Based on the 'Outcomes Based on Goals' analysis, the highest number of successful plays is 388 with a goal of
       $1000 to $4999 while the highest number of failed plays was 146 also at a goal of $1000 to $4999. Even
       though the percentage in 'Percentage Successful' is lower in the 1000 to 4999 goal, there are more
       successful plays compared to the number of successful plays within the >1000 goal. Even if I deducted the
       number of failed plays within the 1000 to 4999 range, there are still 101 plays more successful than that 
       of the successful plays in the >1000 goal. There has also been 0 cancellations of plays within all the goal ranges. 
       Overall, 67% of the plays were successful.

   ### _Challenges and Difficulties Encountered_
  
  ## Results
      
      - Two conclusions that I was able to draw from 'Outcomes Based on Launced Date" data set are:
         (1) We can safely assume that the number of failed outcomes will be half of the number of successful 
             every month.
        
         (2) Louise should sell tickets for her play in the month of May. That's the month where the outcomes were 
             most sucessful and the failed outcomes were less than 50%.
             
      - Based on the data from 'Outcomes Based on Goals', the outcomes from the goal '1000 to 4999' procuded the most successful
        outcomes, even though there were 146 failed outcomes in this goal range.
         
      * Based on the data I have collected, I would advise Loiuse to launch the play in the month of May and prices the tickets
        between $1000 and $4999.
         
      - Some limitations on the dataset would be that the amount pledged, name of play, and country were not included. The amount
        pledged could have told us how much of the goal was actually achieved. The name of the plays would have told us exacly 
        which plays were successful and the country would have narrowed the information down even more. Louise could have used this 
        additional information to know which specific plays, which goals were met and which country, in order to significantly 
        increase the chances of her play being successful.
        
      - Some other graphs I would have used is the Pie Chart and the Box & Whisker. The Pie Chart would have given me a clear 
        visualization of the data in front of me and the Box & Whisker could have pin pointed exactly where the data is, without me 
        trying to follow along the lines of a line graph.
