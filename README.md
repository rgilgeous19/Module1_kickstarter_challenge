# KICKSTARTING WITH EXCEL

  ## Overview of Project
     The overview of the project is to create two new analyses for Louise's play.
    

  ### Purpose
      The purpose of the project is to analyze and determine whether there are specific factors 
      to make a project's campaign successful. I determine if different plays have been more successful, failed
      or canceled based on their launch date or by the goals set the play.
      
      
  ##### Analysis and Challenges
        Based on the _Theater Outcomes by Launch Date_ analysis, I can see that 61.2% of the plays has been successful, 
        36% has failed and 2.8% has been cancelled. The most successful month was May, while the most failed 
        outcomes were also in May. There have also been less than 10 cancelations for each month for one year.
