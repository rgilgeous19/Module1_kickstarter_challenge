# KICKSTARTING WITH EXCEL

  ## Overview of Project
     
    ### Purpose
      The overview of the project is to create two new analyses for Louise's play.The purpose of the project is 
      to analyze and determine whether there are specific factors 
      to make a project's campaign successful. I determine if different plays have been more successful, failed
      or canceled based on their launch date or by the goals set the play.
      
  ## Analysis and Challenges
      
    ### Analysis of Outcomes Bases on Launch Date
       Based on the 'Theater Outcomes by Launch Date' analysis, I can see that 61.2% of the plays has been successful, 
       36% has failed and 2.8% has been cancelled. The most successful month was May, while the most failed 
       outcomes were also in May. There have also been less than 10 cancelations for each month for one year.
